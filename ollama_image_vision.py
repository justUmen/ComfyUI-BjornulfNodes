Guidelines for describing the image:- Focus on visual elements, be specific about objects, colors, textures, and compositions. Use adjectives to describe key features. Avoid complete sentences or narrative descriptions. Prioritize important elements over minor details. Your input will be a detailed description of an image. Process this description and refine it into a prompt suitable for stable diffusion models using the following steps: 1. Identify the most important visual elements and characteristics. 2. Condense the description into a series of comma-separated phrases or words. 3. Prioritize specific, descriptive terms over general ones. Here are two examples of good outputs: Example 1:vibrant sunset, tropical beach, silhouetted palm trees, calm ocean, orange and purple sky, wispy clouds, golden sand, gentle waves, beachgoers in distance, serene atmosphere, warm lighting, panoramic view. Example 2: steampunk cityscape, towering clockwork structures, brass and copper tones, billowing steam, airships in sky, cobblestone streets, Victorian-era citizens, gears and pipes visible, warm sepia lighting, hazy atmosphere, intricate mechanical details. Your final output should be a single line of text containing the refined prompt, without any additional explanation or commentary. IMPORTANT : DO NOT Include information about the overall style or artistic technique.",

Use descriptive language to capture the essence of the image, including the environment, objects, characters, lighting, textures, and any other notable elements. The description must use some of these 9 points : 1. Scene Type: [Outdoor/Indoor/Abstract/Fantasy/Realistic/etc.] 2. Primary Subject: [Main focus or characters in the scene.] 3. Environment Details: [Describe the setting in vivid detail, including any landscapes, architecture, or surroundings.] 4. Lighting: [Specify the type, color, and intensity of the lighting.] 5. Colors and Tones: [Dominant colors and overall mood.] 6. Perspective: [Camera angle or viewpoint—close-up, wide shot, aerial, etc.] 7. Texture and Details: [Surface materials, patterns, and fine details.] 8. Emotion or Atmosphere: [Mood conveyed by the scene—serene, ominous, lively, etc.] 9. Unique Elements: [Special features or focal points that make the image distinctive.] For example: 1. Scene Type: Outdoor, natural landscape. 2. Primary Subject: A majestic lion standing atop a rocky hill. 3. Environment Details: A vast savannah with tall golden grass, sparse acacia trees, and distant mountains under a clear blue sky. 4. Lighting: Bright, warm sunlight casting long shadows. 5. Colors and Tones: Predominantly gold and blue, with subtle earthy browns and greens. 6. Perspective: Mid-range shot, slightly low angle to emphasize the lion's dominance. 7. Texture and Details: The lion's fur appears detailed with visible strands, and the rocks have a rough, weathered texture. 8. Emotion or Atmosphere: Majestic, powerful, and serene. 9. Unique Elements: A subtle wind effect in the grass and mane, adding movement to the scene. IMPORTANT : DO NOT Include information about the overall style or artistic technique."
