# 📝 Nodes descriptions

## 1/2 - 👁 + ✒ Show/Write Text 
![Show Text](screenshots/write+show_text.png)

**Description:**  
Two simple nodes to write and show text.
Write node is a textarea where you can write your text.  
The show text node will only display the text. (That's why I made it a different color : green, uneditable, display only.)

## 3 - 🔗 Combine Texts
![Combine Texts](screenshots/combine_texts.png)

**Description:**  
Combine multiple text inputs into a single output. (can have separation with : comma, space, new line.)

## 4 - 🎲 Random Text
![Random Text](screenshots/random_text.png)

**Description:**  
Generate and display random text from a predefined list. Great for creating random prompts.

## 5 - ♻ Loop
![Loop](screenshots/loop.png)

**Description:**  
General-purpose loop node.

## 6 - ♻ Loop Texts
![Loop Texts](screenshots/loop_texts.png)

**Description:**  
Cycle through a list of text inputs. Great for creating dynamic text-based presentations.

## 7 - ♻ Loop Integer
![Loop Integer](screenshots/loop_integer.png)
![Loop Int + Show Text](screenshots/loop_int+show_text.png)

**Description:**  
Iterate through a range of integer values, good for `steps` in ksampler, etc...

❗ Don't forget that you can convert ksampler widgets to input by right-clicking the ksampler node :
![Widget to Input](screenshots/widget-to-input.png)

## 8 - ♻ Loop Float
![Loop Float](screenshots/loop_float.png)
![Loop Float + Show Text](screenshots/loop_float+show_text.png)

**Description:**  
Loop through a range of floating-point numbers, good for `cfg`, `denoise`, etc...

## 10 - ♻ Loop All Samplers
![Loop All Samplers](screenshots/loop_all_samplers.png)

**Description:**  
Iterate over all available samplers to apply them sequentially. Ideal for testing.

## 11 - ♻ Loop All Schedulers
![Loop All Schedulers](screenshots/loop_all_schedulers.png)

**Description:**  
Iterate over all available schedulers to apply them sequentially. Ideal for testing.

## 12 - ♻ Loop Combos
![Loop Combos](screenshots/loop_combos.png)

**Description:**  
Generate a loop from a list of my own custom combinations (scheduler+sampler), or select one combo manually.  
Good for testing.

## 13/14 - 📏 + 🖼 Resize and Save Exact name ⚠️💣
![Resize and Save Exact](screenshots/resize_save_exact.png)

**Description:**  
Resize an image to exact dimensions. The other node will save the image to the exact path.  
⚠️💣 Warning : The image will be overwritten if it already exists.

## 15 - 💾 Save Text
![Save Text](screenshots/save_text.png)

**Description:**  
Save the given text input to a file. Useful for logging and storing text data.

## 16 - 🖼💬 Save image for Bjornulf LobeChat (❗For my custom [lobe-chat](https://github.com/justUmen/Bjornulf_lobe-chat)❗)
![Save Bjornulf Lobechat](screenshots/save_bjornulf_lobechat.png)

**Description:**  
❓ I made that node for my custom lobe-chat to send+receive images from Comfyui API : [lobe-chat](https://github.com/justUmen/Bjornulf_lobe-chat)  
It will save the image in the folder `output/BJORNULF_LOBECHAT/`. 
The name will start at `api_00001.png`, then `api_00002.png`, etc...  
It will also create a link to the last generated image at the location `output/BJORNULF_API_LAST_IMAGE.png`.  
This link will be used by my custom lobe-chat to copy the image inside the lobe-chat project.  

## 17 - 🖼 Save image as `tmp_api.png` Temporary API ⚠️💣
![Save Temporary API](screenshots/save_tmp_api.png)

**Description:**  
Save image for short-term use : ./output/tmp_api.png ⚠️💣  

## 18 - 🖼📁 Save image to a chosen folder name
![Save Temporary API](screenshots/save_image_to_folder.png)

**Description:**  
Save image in a specific folder : `my_folder/00001.png`, `my_folder/00002.png`, etc...  
Also allow multiple nested folders, like for example : `animal/dog/small`.

## 19 - 🦙 Ollama
![Show Text](screenshots/ollama.png)

**Description:**  
Will generate detailed text based of what you give it.  
I recommend using `mistral-nemo` if you can run it, but it's up to you. (Might have to tweak the system prompt a bit)  
⚠️ Warning : Having an ollama node that will run for each generation might be a bit heavy on your VRAM. Think about if you really need it or not.

**Description:**  
Straight forward node to write and show text.

## 20 - 📹 Video Ping Pong
![Video Ping Pong](screenshots/video_pingpong.png)

**Description:**  
Create a ping-pong effect from a list of images (from a video) by reversing the playback direction when reaching the last frame. Good for an "infinity loop" effect.

## 21 - 📹 Images to Video
![Images to Video](screenshots/imgs2video.png)

**Description:**  
Combine a sequence of images into a video file.  
❓ I made this node because it supports transparency with webm format. (Needed for rembg)  
Temporary images are stored in the folder `ComfyUI/temp_images_imgs2video/` as well as the wav audio file.

## 22 - 🔲 Remove image Transparency (alpha)
![Remove Alpha](screenshots/remove_alpha.png)

**Description:**  
Remove transparency from an image by filling the alpha channel with a solid color. (black, white or greenscreen)  
Of course it takes in an image with transparency, like from rembg nodes.  
Necessary for some nodes that don't support transparency.  

## 23 - 🔲 Image to grayscale (black & white)
![Image to Grayscale](screenshots/grayscale.png)

**Description:**  
Convert an image to grayscale (black & white)  
Example : I sometimes use it with Ipadapter to disable color influence.  
But you can sometimes also want a black and white image... 

## 24 - 🖼+🖼 Combine images (Background + Overlay)
![Combine Images](screenshots/combine_background_overlay.png)

**Description:**  
Combine two images into a single image : a background and one (or several) transparent overlay. (allow to have a video there, just send all the frames and recombine them after.)  
Update 0.11 : Add option to move vertically and horizontally. (from -50% to 150%)  
❗ Warning : For now, `background` is a static image. (I will allow video there later too.)  
⚠️ Warning : If you want to directly load the image with transparency, use my node `🖼 Load Image with Transparency ▢` instead of the `Load Image` node.  

## 25 - 🟩➜▢ Green Screen to Transparency
![Greenscreen to Transparency](screenshots/greeenscreen_to_transparency.png)

**Description:**  
Transform greenscreen into transparency.  
Need clean greenscreen ofc. (Can adjust threshold but very basic node.)

## 26 - 🎲 Random line from input
![Random line from input](screenshots/random_line_from_input.png)

**Description:**  
Take a random line from an input text. (When using multiple "Write Text" nodes is annoying for example, you can use that and just copy/paste a list from outside.)

## 27 - ♻ Loop (All Lines from input)
![Loop input](screenshots/loop_all_lines.png)

**Description:**  
Iterate over all lines from an input text. (Good for testing multiple lines of text.)

## 28 - 🔢 Text with random Seed

**Description:**  

❗ This node is used to force to generate a random seed, along with text.  
But what does that mean ???  
When you use a loop (♻), the loop will use the same seed for each iteration. (That is the point, it will keep the same seed to compare results.)  
Even with `randomize` for `control_after_generate`, it is still using the same seed for every loop, it will change it only when the workflow is done.  
Simple example without using random seed node : (Both images have different prompt, but same seed)  

![Text with random Seed 1](screenshots/random_seed_1.png)

So if you want to force using another seed for each iteration, you can use this node in the middle.
For example, if you want to generate a different image every time. (aka : You use loop nodes not to compare or test results but to generate multiple images.)  
Use it like that for example : (Both images have different prompt AND different seed)  

![Text with random Seed 2](screenshots/random_seed_2.png)

Here is an example of the similarities that you want to avoid with FLUX with different prompt (hood/helmet) but same seed :

![Text with random Seed 3](screenshots/random_seed_3_flux.png)

Here is an example of the similarities that you want to avoid with SDXL with different prompt (blue/red) but same seed :

![Text with random Seed 4](screenshots/random_seed_4_sdxl.png)

FLUX : Here is an example of 4 images without Random Seed node on the left, and on the right 4 images with Random Seed node :

![Text with random Seed 5](screenshots/result_random_seed.png)

## 29 - 🖼 Load Image with Transparency ▢
![Load image Alpha](screenshots/load_image_alpha.png)

**Description:**  
Load an image with transparency.  
The default `Load Image` node will not load the transparency.  

## 30 - 🖼✂ Cut image with a mask
![Cut image](screenshots/image_mask_cut.png)

**Description:**  
Cut an image from a mask.
